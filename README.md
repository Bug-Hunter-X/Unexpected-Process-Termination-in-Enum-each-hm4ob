This example demonstrates a potential pitfall when using `Enum.each` in Elixir along with `Process.exit`.  Improper usage of `Process.exit` within an `Enum.each` function can prematurely terminate the entire process, disrupting any intended continued execution. The solution shows how to handle such scenarios safely by employing alternative functions that provide better control over the loop.
